1. Write a program in Python to find out the character in a string which is uppercase using list
comprehension.
x = [i for i in "Good Morning People" if i.isupper()]
print(x)

2. Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and
their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects.
Let’s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.
HINT - Use Zip function also
Sample input: students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan'] subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']
Expected output: {‘Smit’ : ’CSE’ , ’Jaya’ : ’Networking’ , ’Rayyan’ : ’Operating System’}

students = ['Smit', 'Jaya', 'Rayyan'] 
subjects = ['CSE', 'Networking', 'Operating System']

result = zip(students,subjects)
dict = {k:v for (k,v) in result}
print(dict)

3. Learn More about Yield, next and Generators

4. Write a program in Python using generators to reverse the string.
Input String = “Consultadd Training”
def str(Input_Str):
    yield Input_Str[::-1]

for i in str("Consultadd Training"):
    print(i)
		OR
def rev_gen():
    my_str = "Consultadd Training"
    rev = my_str[::-1]
    yield rev
my_rev = rev_gen()
print(next(my_rev))

5. Write an example on decorators.
def decorator_list(fnc):
    def inner(list_of_tuples):
        return [fnc(val[0], val[1]) for val in list_of_tuples]
    return inner
    
@decorator_list
def add_together(a, b):
    return a + b
print(add_together([(1, 3), (3, 17), (5, 5), (6, 7)]))
