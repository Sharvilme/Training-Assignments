1. Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one of them belongs to a different data type.
a,b,c=10,2.34,"hello"
print(a,b,c)

2. Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.
x=2+2j
print(x)
print(type(x))
y=3
x,y=y,x
print(x)
print(type(x))

3. Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.
With third variable
x=2
y=3
print(x,y)
z=x
x=y
y=z
print(x,y)
without third variable
x=2
y=3
print(x,y)
x,y=y,x
print(x,y)

4. Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.x Version.
Python 2.x
x=raw_input("Name : ")
print x

Python 3.x
x=input("Name : ")
print(x)

5. Write a program to complete the task given below:
Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum in another variable called z.
Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as the final output.
x=int(input("Enter a number between 1-10: "))
y=int(input("Enter another number between 1-10: "))
z=x+y
result=z+30
print(result)

6. Write a program to check the data type of the entered values. HINT: Printed output should say - The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc
a=5
print("The data type of the input value is :",type(a))
b=2.5
print("The data type of the input value is :",type(b))
c='hello'
print("The data type of the input value is :",type(c))

7. Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase and UPPERCASE.
Upper CamelCase
a='HelloEveryone'
Lower CamelCase
b='helloEveryone'
SnakeCase
c="hello_everyone"
UPPERCASE
d="HELLOEVERYONE"

8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’ again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?
Yes. The value of 'a' will change and it will take the new value.
If we change the data type, then its value will remain same but will be represented differently like int 10 will become float 10.0
